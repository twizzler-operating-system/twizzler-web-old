		<h1>About</h1>

		<h2>What is Twizzler?</h2>
		<p>Twizzler is a new operating system. It was designed by the Center for Research in Storage
		Systems, primarily by Daniel Bittman, Peter Alvaro, and Ethan L. Miller. It's design is
		centered around a "data-centric model", that is to say, a model in which the persistent data
		that applications access is the "primary citizen" instead of a process, as is common in
		other operating systems. Concretely, this translates to programs operating on persistent
		data with in-memory semantics without the added complexity of serialization or the added
		latency of explicit load and unload system calls.</p>

		<p>Twizzler is motivated by a convergence of persistence and low-latency memory, realized
		through the introduction of byte-addressable NVM technologies like Optane DC memory. Our
		design enables both effective direct access to NVM and effective sharing of persistent
		objects both between different applications (through interoperability of persistent
		pointers) and across address spaces and machines (by providing a global address space). The
		latter means that Twizzler also provides an effective solution to low-coordination sharing and
		concurrent access to persistent data in a <i>global</i> space of data objects, a vital
		feature with the increasing disaggregation and sizes of memories.</p>

		<p>For more information, see our publications.</p>

		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>
		Twizzler's kernel is very small. It's goal is to support a user-space environment that
		handles the majority of the day-to-day OS operations. The kernel provides a simple set of
		primitives for thread management and synchronization, data object management, and talking to
		devices. It acts as the trusted computing base which is primarily responsible for
		multiplexing and virtualizing hardware, and mapping data objects into address spaces for
		user-space programs.

		<h2>How can I try it out?</h2>

		<p>Twizzler is available for downloading in the Downloads page, in both pre-built and source
		code form. The pre-built image provides a very basic environment. The source code provides a
		method for building the code into a usable image. <strong>NOTE: this is a <i>research</i>
			OS! It is unstable and should be used with care in production environments.</strong> We
		assume you know what you are doing when you try to use it :)</p>

		<h3> How can I write code for it?</h3>
		<p>
		See us/playground/README.md for details in the source repo.
