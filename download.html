		<h1>Downloads</h1>

		<p>
		Twizzler is available as both a pre-built image and source code.
		</p>

		<div style="background-color: #2ecc71;">
			<p><strong> Latest Release: Version 0.2. See <a href="">Documentation</a> for the changelog. </strong></p>
		</div>



		<p>IMPORTANT: Twizzler is a research OS. It is not production-ready (yet). Use it at your
		own risk!</p>

		<h2>Pre-built Images</h2>
		<p>
		You can find pre-built images <a href="/pub/releases">here</a>. The zip file contains a
		README with instructions for how to run Twizzler on an QEMU (an emulator). Please read this
		file as it contains demos and guides for using the system.</p>

		<h2>Source Code</h2>
		<p>
		The source-code for Twizzler is available at <a href="https://github.com/twizzler-operating-system/twizzler-public">this</a>
		github repository. This repo is a public-facing version of our internal code-base, and may
		be behind the latest development versions a bit.</p>

		<p>The Twizzler source contains a build-system designed to bootstrap a Twizzler image
		(kernel, userspace, ISO images, etc.). Details for using it can be found in
		doc/building.txt. Please read the README file, as it contains useful information for
		familiarizing yourself with the source tree.</p>

		<h3>Missing Code</h3>
		<p>
		There are currently some features referenced in papers that are missing from this source
		repo. The reason is that we are currently porting some of these from our previous prototype
		system, or are re-writing them using new functionality. For example, <i>logboi</i>, the
		logging daemon, is being re-written with new security system APIs which are part of an
		upcoming paper on the Twizzler security model. Part of the reason this is all still
		in-progress is COVID-related. As for APIs like security, we'd rather not release them until
		they are stable!
		<p>

		<h2>Nightly Builds</h2>
		<p>Coming soon...</p>
